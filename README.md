# Energy Manager

## Mockups
Mockups are currently being refined because I have changed the theme of my project. I will update the link here once they are finalized.

## 1. Chosen Architecture
I chose **Option A: Separate HTML files** for each page.

### Reason
This approach is easier for beginners to understand and manage.  
Each page (`index.html`, `log.html`, `activities.html`) is a standalone file, and navigation between them uses simple HTML links (`<a>` tags).  
It also allows testing each page independently without complex JavaScript or frameworks.

## 2. Pages / Sections
The project currently includes the following pages:

| Page | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Overview | `index.html` | Displays today’s energy and remaining energy summary |
| Log | `log.html` | Shows a list of past daily energy logs |
| Activities | `activities.html` | Lists activities that affect energy (e.g., exercise, study, rest) |

## 3. Navigation Design
The navigation system is consistent across all pages.  
Users can switch between sections using the top navigation bar:

## Week 9 Update

### Overview
This week, I started implementing JavaScript to make my web pages more dynamic.  
I created a `section` and `div` in my HTML to display content generated by JavaScript.  
Then, I used an array of objects in `app.js` to populate energy-saving suggestions dynamically.

### Key Changes
- Added a `dynamic-content` section to `index.html`.
- Implemented a JavaScript array (`suggestions`) to store data.
- Used `forEach()` to loop through data and create HTML elements.
- Connected the new script to the HTML page.

### Challenges
- Getting the elements to appear in the right place took a bit of debugging.
- I had to double-check how to properly use `appendChild()` for dynamic content.

### Next Steps
- Add styling to the dynamically generated content.
- Create and link mockups.
- Refine the data and structure for better readability.

<nav>
  <a href="index.html">Overview</a>
  <a href="log.html">Log</a>
  <a href="activities.html">Activities</a>
